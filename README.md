This executable program can forecast the guidance value (land-rate) for a ward/hobli and year of choice. The respective ward (urban districts) and hoblis (rural districts) can be chosen accordingly from the excel files and the desired year can be inputted to obtain the forecasted land-rate values. 
The guidance value and growth pixel count database was consolidated by obtaining the individual land-rate values and calculating the pixel count for each district using QGIS software. It also includes the regression equations correlating the urban-growth with the land-rates.
